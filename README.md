# Spritesheet-Viewer
A spritesheet viewer for my game development, using pygame. 

### A short description
I am making this app for my game development, for I wanted to see how the sprite animation will look like before putting it into the game. Having using PyGame, we thus, need to make a visual observation to see if the animation fits in the game, whether we need to slow it down or make it faster. Although my aim is to make it as general as possible, but for now it is very much fits in my game. For example, the white background fits my spritesheet, but maybe not others. Another example, is that the application is tied to my code of splicing the sprite sheet and other people may use other functions. Some intented improvement is listed below (though, no promise when it will be implemented).

### Some intended improvement (not follwing any order of importance)
+ Manual insertion of beginning and ending of sprite sheet
+ Manual adjustment of width and hight for each panel for non-uniform sprite sheet
+ Changing background color
+ Application menu
+ Adding background Rect frame for reference
+ Edit panel
+ Delete panel

### Library needed
Some libraries that are needed are:
+ pygame
+ sys
+ tkinter

### Running the application
For now we just need python 3 to execute it. For Ubuntu linux and similar OSes (that's the only OS that I have, sorry) open the terminal at the folder location, and just run:
```
python Spritesheet_Viewer.py
```
(Here I am using python as Ubuntu has defaulted python 3 to the command python. For some other distribution you might want to use python3). I assume other OS would operate similarly. 

### Usage
